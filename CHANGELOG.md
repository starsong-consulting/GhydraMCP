## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **String Data Listing:** Added a new endpoint to list string data in the binary, with pagination and filtering by content. Python bridge support via `list_strings()` function. (f71f4aa)
- **Comprehensive Data Manipulation:** Added tools/endpoints for creating (`create_data`), deleting (`delete_data`), renaming (`rename_data`), changing type (`set_data_type`), and combined updates (`update_data`) for data items. Supports common types (byte, word, dword, string, etc.). (6c28553, 5797fb3, 28870e9)
- **Enhanced Cross-Reference (Xrefs) Analysis:** Implemented accurate xref tools (`get_references_to`, `get_references_from`) using Ghidra's ReferenceManager. Features include detailed info, bi-directional search, type filtering, and simplified bridge output. (96788f3)
- **Memory Operations:** Added tools/endpoints for reading (`read_memory`) and writing (`write_memory`) to program memory. (454c739)
- **Function Addressing Flexibility:** MCP bridge now supports addressing functions by name or address. (4f3042f)
- **API Version Check:** Bridge script now verifies compatibility with the Java plugin (expects API v2). (fedd2d0)
- **Enhanced Decompiler Controls:** Added options for raw vs. clean pseudocode output and multiple simplification styles. (454c739)

### Changed
- **Breaking: HATEOAS API v2 & Bridge Update:** Migrated fully to a HATEOAS-driven API (v2). The Python bridge (`bridge_mcp_hydra.py`) now *exclusively* uses this API, removing legacy support. Responses are simplified for AI agents, including text representations for structured data (e.g., disassembly). All endpoints require HATEOAS compliance (e.g., `_links`). (4bc2267, 4f3042f)
- **Optimized Variable Listing:** Improved performance of the `/variables` endpoint with efficient pagination and a `globalOnly` filter. (6c865c4)
- **Standardized Responses:** Unified all endpoints to use structured JSON and standardized HATEOAS links. (454c739, 4bc2267)
- **Improved Error Handling:** Enhanced error reporting and parameter validation across the API and bridge. (454c739, 4f3042f, 3df129f)
- **API Documentation:** Updated documentation to reflect the HATEOAS v2 API and new features. (28870e9, 3fd0cf4)

### Fixed
- **Variable Renaming:** Fixed handling of variable operations in URL paths, allowing proper renaming of decompiler-generated variables through the API. (f377a34, c4d170c)
- **Function Creation:** Improved function creation by attempting to disassemble memory before creating functions, which helps in correctly identifying function boundaries. (25f353a)
- **Real Instruction Disassembly:** The `/disassembly` endpoint now provides actual instruction disassembly instead of placeholders. (3df129f)
- **Ghidra 11+ Compatibility:** Resolved various API compatibility issues, particularly for cross-references (`XrefsEndpoints`). (5dc59ce, 2b1fe6c, 0eaa19a, 9443101)
- **Data Operations:** Fixed issues with HTTP request body consumption, parameter naming (`type` vs `dataType`), and name preservation during type changes. (28870e9)
- **Function Commenting:** Corrected `set_decompiler_comment` to apply comments at the function level. (2a1607c)
- **Endpoint Functionality:** Addressed various issues including endpoint registration, handling of program-dependent endpoints, URL encoding, transaction management, and inconsistent response formats. (various commits, e.g., 4bc2267)
