# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated port range calculations to use DEFAULT_GHIDRA_PORT
- Cleaned up comments and simplified code in bridge_mcp_hydra.py
- Improved error handling and response formatting
- Standardized API response structure across all endpoints

### Added
- Added GHIDRA_HTTP_API.md with documentation of the Java Plugin's HTTP API
- Added better docstrings and type hints for all MCP tools
- Added improved content-type handling for API requests
- Added decompiler output controls to customize analysis results:
  - Choose between clean C-like pseudocode (default) or raw decompiler output
  - Toggle syntax tree visibility for detailed analysis
  - Select different simplification styles for alternate views
  - Useful for comparing different decompilation approaches or focusing on specific aspects of the code
  
  Example showing how to get raw decompiler output with syntax tree:
  ```xml
  <use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>ghydra</server_name>
  <tool_name>decompile_function_by_address</tool_name>
  <arguments>
  {
    "address": "0x1000",
    "cCode": false,
    "syntaxTree": true
  }
  </arguments>
  </use_mcp_tool>
  ```
