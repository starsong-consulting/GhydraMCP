# GhydraMCP v2.0

GhydraMCP is a powerful bridge between [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and AI assistants that enables comprehensive AI-assisted reverse engineering through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp).

![GhydraMCP logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86b9b2de-767c-4ed5-b082-510b8109f00f)

## Overview

GhydraMCP v2.0 integrates three key components:

1. **Modular Ghidra Plugin**: Exposes Ghidra's powerful reverse engineering capabilities through a HATEOAS-driven REST API
2. **MCP Bridge**: A Python script that translates MCP requests into API calls with comprehensive type checking
3. **Multi-instance Architecture**: Connect multiple Ghidra instances to analyze different binaries simultaneously

This architecture enables AI assistants like Claude to seamlessly:
- Decompile and analyze binary code with customizable output formats
- Map program structures, function relationships, and complex data types
- Perform advanced binary analysis (cross-references, call graphs, data flow, etc.)
- Make precise modifications to the analysis (rename, annotate, create/delete/modify data, etc.)
- Read memory directly and manipulate binary at a low level
- Navigate resources through discoverable HATEOAS links

GhydraMCP is based on [GhidraMCP by Laurie Wired](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/) but has evolved into a comprehensive reverse engineering platform with enhanced multi-instance support, extensive data manipulation capabilities, and a robust HATEOAS-compliant API architecture.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)
- Python3
- MCP [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)

## Ghidra
First, download the latest [release](https://github.com/teal-bauer/GhydraMCP/releases) from this repository. The "Complete" artifact contains the zipped Ghidra plugin and the Python MCP bridge. Unpack the outer archive, then, add the plugin to Ghidra:

1. Run Ghidra
2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`
3. Click the `+` button
4. Select the `GhydraMCP-2.0.0-beta.1.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release
5. Restart Ghidra
6. Make sure the GhydraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`

> **Note:** By default, the first CodeBrowser opened in Ghidra gets port 8192, the second gets 8193, and so on. You can check which ports are being used by looking at the Console in the Ghidra main (project) window - click the computer icon in the bottom right to "Open Console". Look for log entries like:
> ```
> (HydraMCPPlugin) Plugin loaded on port 8193
> (HydraMCPPlugin) HydraMCP HTTP server started on port 8193
> ```
>
> GhydraMCP now includes auto-discovery of running Ghidra instances, so manually registering each instance is typically not necessary. The MCP bridge will automatically discover and register instances on startup and periodically check for new ones.

2. Name: GhydraMCP
3. Command: `uv run /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_hydra.py`

## Example Session

Below is an example of how an AI assistant might interact with multiple Ghidra instances using GhydraMCP:

**User:**
```
Check which Ghidra instances are currently running.
```

**Assistant:**
```
I'll check which Ghidra instances are currently running by discovering any active instances.

View result from discover_instances from ghydra (local)
{
  "found": 2,
  "instances": [
    {
      "port": 8192,
      "url": "http://localhost:8192",
      "result": "Registered instance on port 8192 at http://localhost:8192"
    },
    {
      "port": 8193,
      "url": "http://localhost:8193",
      "result": "Registered instance on port 8193 at http://localhost:8193"
    }
  ]
}

View result from list_instances from ghydra (local)
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "port": 8192,
      "url": "http://localhost:8192",
      "project": "TestProject",
      "file": "application.exe"
    },
    {
      "port": 8193,
      "url": "http://localhost:8193",
      "project": "FirmwareAnalysis",
      "file": "firmware.bin"
    }
  ]
}

I found two active Ghidra instances:
1. Port 8192: Analyzing "application.exe" in project "TestProject"
2. Port 8193: Analyzing "firmware.bin" in project "FirmwareAnalysis"

I'm ready to analyze these binaries. What would you like me to examine?
```

**User:**
```
List the functions through ghydra for both instances and identify any related functionality.
```

**Assistant:**
```
I'll list the functions from both instances and analyze them.

View result from list_functions from ghydra (local){
  `port`: 8192
}
[Function list for application.exe...]

View result from list_functions from ghydra (local){
  `port`: 8193
}
[Function list for firmware.bin...]

I notice some interesting functions in both binaries. Let me decompile a few to understand their behavior.

View result from get_function from ghydra (local){
  `port`: 8192,
  `name`: "process_command"
}
[Decompiled code for process_command...]

View result from get_function from ghydra (local){
  `port`: 8193,
  `name`: "handle_message"
}
[Decompiled code for handle_message...]

Based on this analysis, I can see these binaries communicate using a simple protocol where...
```

# JSON Communication

GhydraMCP uses structured JSON for all communication between the Python bridge and Java plugin. This ensures consistent and reliable data exchange.

## API Architecture

GhydraMCP v2.0 implements a comprehensive HATEOAS-driven REST API that follows hypermedia design principles:

### Core API Design

- **HATEOAS Architecture**: Each response includes navigational links for resource discovery
- **Versioned Endpoints**: All requests verified against API version for compatibility
- **Structured Responses**: Standardized JSON format with consistent field naming
- **Proper HTTP Methods**: GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal
- **Appropriate Status Codes**: Uses standard HTTP status codes for clear error handling

### Response Format

All responses follow this HATEOAS-driven format:

```json
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "instance": "http://localhost:8192",
  "success": true,
  "result": "...",
  "timestamp": 1712159482123,
  "_links": {
    "self": {"href": "/endpoint/current"},
    "related": [
      {"href": "/endpoint/related1", "name": "Related Resource 1"},
      {"href": "/endpoint/related2", "name": "Related Resource 2"}
    ]
  }
}
```

For list responses, pagination information is included:

```json
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "instance": "http://localhost:8192",
  "success": true,
  "result": [ ... objects ... ],
  "size": 150,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 50,
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/functions?offset=0&limit=50" },
    "next": { "href": "/functions?offset=50&limit=50" },
    "prev": { "href": "/functions?offset=0&limit=50" }
  }
}
```

Error responses include detailed information:

```json
{
  "id": "req-123",
  "instance": "http://localhost:8192",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Function 'main' not found in current program"
  },
  "status_code": 404,
  "timestamp": 1712159482123,
  "_links": {
    "self": {"href": "/functions/main"}
  }
}
```

This HATEOAS approach enables resource discovery and self-documenting APIs, making integration and exploration significantly easier.

# Testing

GhydraMCP includes comprehensive test suites for both the HTTP API and MCP bridge. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details on running the tests.

## HTTP API Tests

Tests the HTTP endpoints exposed by the Java plugin:
- Response format and structure
- JSON structure consistency
- Required fields in responses
- Error handling

## MCP Bridge Tests

Tests the MCP bridge functionality:
- MCP protocol communication
- Tool availability and structure
- Response format and structure
- JSON structure consistency

# Building from Source

You can build different artifacts with Maven:

## Build Everything (Default)
Build both the Ghidra plugin and the complete package:

```
mvn clean package
```

This creates:
- `target/GhydraMCP-[version].zip` - The Ghidra plugin only
- `target/GhydraMCP-Complete-[version].zip` - Complete package with plugin and bridge script

## Build Ghidra Plugin Only
If you only need the Ghidra plugin:

```
mvn clean package -P plugin-only
```

## Build Complete Package Only
If you only need the combined package:

```
mvn clean package -P complete-only
```

The Ghidra plugin includes these files required for Ghidra to recognize the extension:
- lib/GhydraMCP.jar
- extension.properties
- Module.manifest
