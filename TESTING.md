# Testing GhydraMCP

This document describes how to test the GhydraMCP plugin and bridge.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Ghidra with the GhydraMCP plugin installed and running
- The `requests` Python package (`pip install requests`)

## Running All Tests

The easiest way to run all tests is to use the test runner script:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This will run both the HTTP API tests and the MCP bridge tests and provide a summary of the results.

You can also run specific test suites:

```bash
# Run only the HTTP API tests
python run_tests.py --http

# Run only the MCP bridge tests
python run_tests.py --mcp
```

## HTTP API Tests

The `test_http_api.py` script tests the HTTP API exposed by the Java plugin. It verifies that the endpoints return the expected JSON structure and that the response format is consistent.

### Running the HTTP API Tests

1. Make sure Ghidra is running with the GhydraMCP plugin loaded
2. Run the tests:

```bash
python test_http_api.py
```

The tests will automatically skip if Ghidra is not running or if the plugin is not responding.

### What's Being Tested

- Basic connectivity to the plugin
- Response format and structure
- JSON structure consistency
- Required fields in responses
- Error handling

## MCP Bridge Tests

The `test_mcp_client.py` script tests the MCP bridge functionality using the MCP client library. It verifies that the bridge responds correctly to MCP requests and that the response format is consistent.

### Running the MCP Bridge Tests

1. Make sure Ghidra is running with the GhydraMCP plugin loaded
2. Run the tests:

```bash
python test_mcp_client.py
```

The test script will:
1. Connect to the bridge using the MCP client
2. Initialize the session
3. List the available tools
4. Call the list_instances tool
5. Call the discover_instances tool
6. Call the list_functions tool

### What's Being Tested

- MCP protocol communication
- Tool availability and structure
- Response format and structure
- JSON structure consistency
- Required fields in responses
- Proper initialization of the MCP session
- Ability to call tools and receive responses

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP API Tests

- If tests are skipped with "Ghidra server not running or not accessible", make sure Ghidra is running and the GhydraMCP plugin is loaded.
- If tests fail with connection errors, check that the plugin is listening on the expected port (default: 8192).

### MCP Bridge Tests

- If tests are skipped with "Failed to start MCP bridge process", check that the bridge script is executable and that all dependencies are installed.
- If tests fail with JSON parsing errors, check that the bridge is responding with valid JSON.

## Adding New Tests

### HTTP API Tests

To add a new test for an HTTP endpoint:

1. Add a new test method to the `GhydraMCPHttpApiTests` class
2. Use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the endpoint
3. Verify the response using assertions

Example:

```python
def test_new_endpoint(self):
    """Test the /new_endpoint endpoint"""
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/new_endpoint")
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
    
    # Verify response is valid JSON
    data = response.json()
    
    # Check required fields in the standard response format
    self.assertIn("success", data)
    self.assertTrue(data["success"])
    self.assertIn("timestamp", data)
    self.assertIn("port", data)
```

### MCP Bridge Tests

To add a new test for an MCP tool:

1. Add a new test method to the `MCPBridgeTests` class
2. Use the `send_mcp_request` method to send an MCP request to the bridge
3. Verify the response using assertions

Example:

```python
def test_new_tool(self):
    """Test the new_tool tool"""
    response = self.send_mcp_request("call_tool", {
        "name": "new_tool",
        "arguments": {
            "param1": "value1",
            "param2": "value2"
        }
    })
    
    # Check basic response structure
    self.assertIn("result", response)
    self.assertIn("content", response["result"])
    
    # Parse the content
    content = response["result"]["content"]
    self.assertIsInstance(content, list)
    self.assertGreaterEqual(len(content), 1)
```
